## data

We are using bee colony losses data from the [USDA](https://usda.library.cornell.edu/concern/publications/rn301137d?locale=en) that I found while exploring datasets in the [TidyTuesday Github](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data). 

The [Bee colony loss data dictionary](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-01-11/readme.md) is very handy as well to get to know the dataset.
